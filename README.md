# AIAssignments_USCOTS25

This respository holds the poster, sample assignments, and other materials relating to the USCOTS poster presentation "If You Can't Beat It: Require It!" by Savvy Barnes (barne329@msu.edu).

The assignments within this repository were mandatory AI/LLM questions on larger homework assignments given to a graduate statistics/data science course in Spring 2025. Not all assignments or questions are present here, and some have been modified to protect future students and assignments. 

In the future, assignments that have not been used but have been developed for future use may be added. These will be labeled at the top of the respective files, and they will be held within their own folder.
